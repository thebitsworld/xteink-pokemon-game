# File Formats

These formats describe global and per-book SD-card files under `/.crosspoint/`.
All POD fields are written in the ESP32 little-endian representation used by
`Serialization.h`; strings are length-prefixed UTF-8 unless a format notes a
fixed-size char buffer.

## `/.crosspoint/pokemon-{a,b}.bin`

### Version 3

Version 3 appends two fields after the version 2 state payload, without
moving or resizing anything at offsets 0-115: a 77-entry item-count bag
(`u8` each, one per non-stone item — Poké/Great/Ultra/Master Ball, potions
and other medicine, status cures, Rare Candy, PP restoratives, and the 50
TMs + 5 HMs; ids 1-6, the six evolution stones, remain in the existing
version-2 item-count array) and a `u16` gym/Elite Four progress bitmask (bit
`N` for `0 <= N < 8` = gym `N+1` defeated, bit `8+M` for `0 <= M < 4` = Elite
Four member `M+1` defeated; the remaining 4 bits are reserved and must be
zero). The 195-byte version 3 state payload is the version 2 payload below,
plus:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 116 | 77 | Non-stone item counts (`u8` each) |
| 193 | 2 | Gym/Elite Four progress bitmask |

A `PendingEventKind` value of `4` (`MoveLearn`) was added; it reuses the
existing 10-byte pending-event layout unchanged — species ID holds the move
ID being learned (1-165) and level holds the level it was learned at.

A file's live battle state (which 4 moves a Party member currently knows,
each move's remaining PP, current HP, and any status ailment) is **not**
stored here. It lives in the separate `/.crosspoint/pokemon-battle-{a,b}.bin`
(see below), itself double-buffered like this file — a Pokémon's moveset can
be changed by the player (TM/HM, the Moveset screen) independently of its
level, so it is no longer purely reconstructible and gets the same
crash-safety as the main save.

### Version 2

The `pokemon-x3` build alternates complete snapshots between
`pokemon-a.bin` and `pokemon-b.bin`. Startup validates both files and uses
the newest supported sequence. A commit streams the active roster into the
inactive file, applies at most one append or replacement, syncs and closes it,
then reopens and verifies the complete snapshot before making it active. The
older file is not removed, so an interrupted write leaves a bootable snapshot.
If either slot uses a newer unsupported format, an older build refuses to write
instead of risking progress loss by truncating that slot. An unsupported slot
paired with a corrupt slot is reported as corruption rather than a safe upgrade
case.

If neither current filename exists, startup validates the earlier
`pokemon-v2-a.bin` and `pokemon-v2-b.bin` files, atomically renames the newest
valid snapshot to `pokemon-a.bin`, and verifies it again before use. The older
legacy snapshot remains untouched as a recovery copy.

If `sync()` reports failure after all bytes were written, the live store keeps
using its previous snapshot and reports failure. A later startup may use either
the previous snapshot or the fully written higher-sequence snapshot, but only
after complete size, record, reference, and CRC validation. It never accepts a
partial snapshot.

All integers are explicitly encoded little-endian; C++ struct padding is never
written. The file is:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Magic `PKV2` |
| 4 | 2 | Format version (`1`, `2`, or `3`; a build always writes the newest it knows) |
| 6 | 2 | Header size (`24`) |
| 8 | 4 | Non-zero snapshot sequence |
| 12 | 2 | State size (`116` for version 2, `195` for version 3 — see per-version tables below) |
| 14 | 2 | Record size (`48`) |
| 16 | 4 | Record count |
| 20 | 4 | Payload size (`116 + recordCount * 48`) |
| 24 | 116 | Encoded `PokemonState` |
| 140 | `recordCount * 48` | Records in ascending record/capture ID order |
| end - 4 | 4 | Standard CRC-32 over header, state, and records |

The 116-byte state payload is:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 24 | Six Party record IDs (`u32` each; packed from slot 1) |
| 24 | 30 | Three compacted pending events (`10` bytes each) |
| 54 | 12 | Six evolution-item counts (`u16` each) |
| 66 | 19 | Seen Pokédex bitset, species 1-151 |
| 85 | 19 | Caught Pokédex bitset, species 1-151 |
| 104 | 4 | Lifetime verified-reading minutes |
| 108 | 4 | Snapshot sequence (must match the header) |
| 112 | 1 | Reading-minute remainder (`0-59`) |
| 113 | 1 | Encounter misses (`0-5`; current guarantee threshold is `3`) |
| 114 | 1 | Item misses (`0-19`) |
| 115 | 1 | Dashboard notice for the first queued event |

Each 10-byte pending event contains record ID at offset 0, species ID at 4,
level at 6, gender at 7, item at 8, and kind at 9. Empty entries follow all
populated entries. Index zero is the event currently shown to the user.

### Legacy version 1

Version 1 uses a 96-byte state payload and stores one pending event at offsets
24-33. Its remaining fields begin at offset 34, with the snapshot sequence at
88 and dashboard notice at 95. The loader accepts version 1 and version 2 in
either alternating slot, selects the newest valid sequence, and places the
legacy event at queue index zero. The next successful save writes version 2;
Pokémon, XP, Party order, items, Pokédex state, pity counters, and reading
progress are preserved.

Each 48-byte record contains record ID at offset 0, total XP at 4, species ID
at 8, caught level at 10, gender at 11, origin at 12, flags at 13, a canonical
33-byte null-padded UTF-8 nickname at 14, and a zero reserved byte at 47.
Record IDs are strictly increasing. Every Party ID and pending evolution ID
must resolve to a record, and every stored record's current species must be
marked caught. PC order is derived without a roster allocation: physical order
is catch order, while Pokédex and alphabetical views rescan through a bounded
19-byte species bitset.

These snapshots are independent from the earlier experimental Pokémon data.
Installing this build starts a new collection unless a valid supported snapshot
is already present. Back up both files before updates or resets. Choosing
**Reset Pokémon** in the Pokémon menu deletes both snapshots and returns to
starter selection; it does not alter books, reading positions, or CrossInk
reading statistics.

## `/.crosspoint/pokemon-battle-{a,b}.bin`

Holds each Party member's *live* battle state: which of its up-to-4 moves it
currently knows, each move's remaining PP, its current HP, and any status
ailment. Introduced alongside save format version 3 above.

### Version 2 (double-buffered)

A Pokémon's actual moveset can diverge from what would be reconstructed
purely from its level (TM/HM teaching, and the Moveset screen's active
learn/forget), so unlike when this file was introduced, it is no longer a
pure cache of the main save: losing it can silently revert a real player
choice, not just reset HP/PP to full. It is therefore double-buffered the
same way as `pokemon-{a,b}.bin` — alternating between `pokemon-battle-a.bin`
and `pokemon-battle-b.bin`, a write always lands on the currently-inactive
file and is read back and verified before the active pointer flips, so an
interrupted write never touches the still-valid other copy.

At most one entry per Party slot (6 maximum); PC-boxed Pokémon are not
battling and carry no entry. Entries are packed at the front in ascending
record-ID order, matching the "no gaps" convention `PokemonState`'s own
arrays use — true of both versions below, not just this one.

All integers are little-endian; each file is:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Magic `PKBT` |
| 4 | 1 | Format version (`1`) |
| 5 | 1 | Entry count (`0`-`6`) |
| 6 | 4 | Non-zero sequence number |
| 10 | `entryCount * 16` | Entries in ascending record-ID order (below) |
| 10 + `entryCount * 16` | 4 | Standard CRC-32 over the header and entries above |

Startup reads both files, decodes whichever validates (correct magic/version,
CRC-32, and a semantically valid state), and uses the one with the higher
sequence number if both are valid. If neither validates — a fresh install,
or both slots somehow lost — every Party member is simply treated as
"unknown" and rebuilt on demand with full HP/PP, no status, and its
learnset-derived moveset; this never blocks play, but is now a last-resort
fallback rather than the everyday path it was under version 1.

### Version 1 (single file, superseded)

The original, pre-migration format: a single `pokemon-battle.bin`, entries
back to back plus a trailing whole-file CRC-32, no header or sequence number.
Considered safe at the time because the whole file was fully reconstructible
from the main save. On first load after upgrading, if neither
`pokemon-battle-a.bin` nor `pokemon-battle-b.bin` exists yet, a pre-existing
`pokemon-battle.bin` is decoded with this legacy layout and immediately
written out as `pokemon-battle-a.bin` (sequence `1`) under the version 2
format above; the legacy file itself is left untouched afterward as a
recovery copy, the same way `pokemon-{a,b}.bin`'s own legacy-filename
migration works. Its layout was:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | `entryCount * 16` | Entries in ascending record-ID order (below) |
| `entryCount * 16` | 4 | Standard CRC-32 over the entries above |

Each 16-byte entry:

| Offset | Size | Field |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | Record ID (matches a `PokemonRecord` in the main save) |
| 4 | 4 | Move IDs (`u8` each, 4 slots; `0` = empty, packed at the front) |
| 8 | 4 | Remaining PP per move slot (`u8` each) |
| 12 | 2 | Current HP |
| 14 | 1 | Status ailment (`0` none, `1` paralysis, `2` sleep, `3` freeze, `4` burn, `5` poison, `6` confusion) |
| 15 | 1 | Status turn counter (sleep/confusion only; `0` for the other four ailments) |

## `/pokemon/`

The locally generated artwork pack is stored separately from firmware state:

```text
/pokemon/
  sprites/001.bmp ... 151.bmp
  heroes/001.bmp  ... 151.bmp
  items/moon-stone.bmp, fire-stone.bmp, thunder-stone.bmp,
        water-stone.bmp, leaf-stone.bmp
  heroes/items/<the same five names>.bmp
  pokedex/portrait/001.bmp ... 151.bmp
  pokedex/landscape/001.bmp ... 151.bmp
```

Species icons are 40×30 one-bit BMPs and presentation sprites are 120×90.
Item icons are 32×32 and item presentation images are 64×64. Missing or invalid
images fall back to text rather than preventing the Pokémon activity from
opening. The Link Cable intentionally has no image. Pokédex detail cards are
one-bit BMPs: 472×708 for portrait and 288×432 for landscape. They are generated
offline so opening a detail page requires no grayscale conversion or large
temporary allocation on the ESP32-C3.

## `book.bin`

### Version 9

`book.bin` stores EPUB metadata plus lookup tables for spine and TOC entries.
The current firmware writes this version from `BookMetadataCache`.
Version 9 stores book and TOC title strings NFC-composed so decomposed
diacritics render correctly with device fonts. It also rebuilds metadata after
the EPUB guide start-reference handling changed.

ImHex pattern:

```c++
import std.mem;
import std.string;
import std.core;

#define EXPECTED_VERSION 9
#define MAX_STRING_LENGTH 65535

struct String {
    u32 length [[hidden, comment("String byte length")]];
    if (length > MAX_STRING_LENGTH) {
        std::warning(std::format("Unusually large string length: {} bytes", length));
    }
    char data[length] [[comment("UTF-8 string data")]];
} [[sealed, format("format_string"), comment("Length-prefixed UTF-8 string")]];

fn format_string(String s) {
    return s.data;
};

struct Metadata {
    String title [[comment("Book title")]];
    String author [[comment("Book author")]];
    String language [[comment("Book language code")]];
    String coverItemHref [[comment("Path to cover image")]];

};

struct TocEntry {

    String href [[comment("Resource path")]];
    String anchor [[comment("Fragment identifier")]];
    u8 level [[comment("Nesting level")]];
    s16 spineIndex [[comment("Index into spine (-1 if none)")]];
};

struct BookBin {
    u8 version;
    if (version != EXPECTED_VERSION) {
        std::error(std::format("Unsupported version: {} (expected {})", version, EXPECTED_VERSION));
    }

    u32 lutOffset [[comment("Offset to lookup tables")]];
    u16 spineCount;
    u16 tocCount;

    Metadata metadata;

    u32 currentOffset = $;
    if (currentOffset != lutOffset) {
        std::warning(std::format("LUT offset mismatch: expected 0x{:X}, got 0x{:X}", lutOffset, currentOffset));
    }

    u32 spineLut[spineCount] [[comment("Spine entry offsets")]];
    u32 tocLut[tocCount] [[comment("TOC entry offsets")]];

    SpineEntry spines[spineCount];
    TocEntry toc[tocCount];
};

BookBin book @ 0x00;

u32 fileSize = std::mem::size();
u32 parsedSize = $;
if (parsedSize != fileSize) {
    std::warning(std::format("Unparsed data detected: {} bytes remaining at offset 0x{:X}", fileSize - parsedSize, parsedSize));
}
```

## `reader_settings.bin`

### Version 5

Each EPUB cache directory may contain `reader_settings.bin`. Missing files mean
the book uses global Reader settings and the default auto-page-turn interval.

Version 1 stored only:

- `u8 version`
- `u16 autoPageTurnSeconds`

Version 2 stores flags before the full reader-settings snapshot. Version 3 adds
the EPUB word-spacing level to that snapshot. Version 4 adds the EPUB indexing
method (`0` = incremental, `1` = full section). Version 5 appends a per-book
dictionary SD-font family name. Version 6 stores reader font sizes as physical
point sizes, and version 7 appends the dictionary font's selected point size.
This lets the
file preserve an auto-page-turn interval without forcing custom font/layout
settings for the book. It also stores a per-book EPUB render mode override,
which can be changed from book action menus before opening the book so a
problematic EPUB can be moved to Balanced or Light rendering without entering
the reader first. Safe Mode also uses this file to save Light rendering with
embedded styles, Bionic Reading, and Guide Dots disabled after that final
fallback successfully opens a difficult book.

```c++
struct ReaderSettingsBin {
    u8 version; // 7
    u8 flags;   // bit 0 = custom reader settings, bit 1 = custom auto-page-turn interval, bit 2 = render mode override, bit 3 = dictionary font override
    u16 autoPageTurnSeconds;
    u8 renderMode; // 0 = CrossInk Default, 1 = Balanced, 2 = Light

    u8 fontFamily;
    u8 readerFontPointSize; // physical point size; versions 2-5 stored a size slot
    u8 lineHeightPercent;
    u8 wordSpacing; // 0 = natural font spacing; 1-4 widen each gap by ~75% per level
    u8 orientation;

    u8 bionicReadingEnabled;
    u8 guideReadingEnabled;
    u8 snapshotRenderMode;
    u8 indexingMethod; // 0 = incremental, 1 = full section
    char sdFontFamilyName[64];
    char dictionarySdFontFamilyName[64]; // meaningful only when flag bit 3 is set
    u8 dictionaryFontPointSize; // 0 = follow reader size
};
```

## `/.crosspoint/clippings/<bookType>_<crc32(path)>.bin`

### Versions 1-3

Clipping files store the per-book EPUB clipping list used by the reader. A
saved clipping is also what CrossInk renders as an in-reader highlight; there is
no separate highlight file. The file lives in `/.crosspoint/clippings/` instead
of the EPUB render-cache directory so clearing/rebuilding layout cache does not
delete user clippings.

The current implementation only writes EPUB clipping files, so `bookType` is
`epub`. The numeric suffix is `uzlib_crc32()` of the book's SD-card path, for
example:

```text
/.crosspoint/clippings/epub_1234567890.bin
```

Binary layout:

- `[0]` version (`1`, `2`, or current version `3`)
- `[1-2]` clipping count (`uint16_t` LE, maximum `256`)
- book title (`String`)
- book author (`String`)
- book path (`String`)
- repeated clipping records:
  - `spineIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `startPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `endPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `pageCount` (`uint16_t` LE, at least `1`)
  - `startWordIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `endWordIndex` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `wordCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
  - `paragraphIndex` (`uint16_t` LE, `UINT16_MAX` when unavailable)
  - `timestamp` (`uint32_t` LE, seconds since firmware boot when saved)
  - version 3 only: reader layout signature (`uint32_t` LE; font, spacing,
    viewport, and other section-layout inputs)
  - `chapterTitle` (`char[48]`, null-terminated/truncated)
  - version 1: selected text (`String`, truncated to `512` bytes for the
    in-app store)
  - versions 2-3: selected-text length (`uint16_t` LE) followed by that many
    UTF-8 bytes (maximum `512`)

CrossInk uses the stored spine/page/paragraph fields as anchors, then searches
near that location for the stored clipping text after relayout. This is similar
to keeping both a DOM position and a text quote in a web app: the numeric
position gives a fast starting point, while the text makes jumps and highlights
survive font, layout, or page-count changes when possible.

Version 3 records which reader layout produced the numeric page/word anchor.
When that signature differs, CrossInk ignores the stale numeric range and
matches the saved text instead, including when both layouts happen to have the
same total page count. Versions 1-2 retain their numeric fast path until the
reader sees a relayout, when it stamps the previously active layout before
rebuilding.

Creating a clipping also appends a Kindle-style export entry to
`/My Clippings.txt` on the SD-card root. That text export can keep up to `2000`
bytes of the selected text and is append-only. Removing a clipping from the
reader deletes or rewrites only the binary clipping file; it does not remove
previous entries from `/My Clippings.txt`.

When CrossInk moves an EPUB through its built-in move-to-Read flow, it rewrites
the clipping file under the new path-derived name and removes the old one. If a
book is renamed or moved outside CrossInk, the path hash changes, so the old
clipping file may no longer be associated with the book until the file is moved
back or the clipping store is migrated.

## `stats_v5.bin`

### Version 5

`stats_v5.bin` stores per-book reading statistics for stats schema version 5.
Versioned filenames let firmware branches with different stats schemas keep
their own per-book stats files without overwriting each other. Version 5 extends
version 4 with a cached live reader book time-left estimate so Home and Reading
Stats can show the same estimate the reader last computed.

When `stats_v5.bin` is missing, CrossInk can read the previous versioned stats
filename (`stats_v4.bin` for version 5, `stats_v5.bin` after a future version 6
bump) before falling back to legacy `stats.bin` files with compatible stats
payloads. Future changes are always saved to the current versioned filename.

Binary layout:

- `[0]` version (`5`)
- `[1-2]` `sessionCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[3-6]` `totalReadingSeconds` (`uint32_t` LE)
- `[7-10]` `totalPagesTurned` (`uint32_t` LE)
- `[11]` `isCompleted` (`uint8_t`)
- `[12-13]` `avgSecondsPerForwardPage` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[14-15]` `paceSampleCount` (`uint16_t` LE)
- `[16]` flags (`bit0=startDateManual`, `bit1=finishedDateManual`)
- `[17-20]` `startDate` (`year uint16_t` LE, `month uint8_t`, `day uint8_t`)
- `[21-24]` `finishedDate` (`year uint16_t` LE, `month uint8_t`, `day uint8_t`)
- `[25-40]` `timeOfDaySeconds[4]` (`uint32_t` LE each)
- `[41-68]` `dayOfWeekSeconds[7]` (`uint32_t` LE each)
- `[69-72]` `estimatedTimeLeftSeconds` (`uint32_t` LE, `0` means unavailable)

## `section.bin`

### Version 63

Each file in `sections/*.bin` stores one laid-out spine section. The header is
also the cache-busting key: if any layout-affecting setting differs from the
current reader settings, the section is discarded and rebuilt.

Version 63 clamps EPUB image top margins to the reader viewport so full-height
images remain inside the drawable page. Finalized version 62 caches and
suspended partial caches marked `0xF7` are rejected and rebuilt; version 63
uses `0xF6` for suspended partial caches.

Version 62 permits line breaks after visible hyphens and dashes and keeps ruby
groups intact across incremental layout flushes. Finalized version 61 caches
and suspended partial caches marked `0xF8` are rejected and rebuilt; version 62
uses `0xF7` for suspended partial caches.

Version 61 expands each footnote target from 96 to 256 bytes, increasing the
fixed footnote record from 129 to 289 bytes. Finalized version 60 caches and
suspended partial caches marked `0xF9` are rejected and rebuilt; version 61
uses `0xF8` for suspended partial caches.

Version 60 reserves page-edge space for ruby overhang and prefers longer
equal-cost CJK lines, invalidating cached pagination from the prior layout
contract.

Version 59 adds a compact page-start visible-text-offset lookup table. The
offset is a Unicode codepoint coordinate in the spine XHTML, so reader progress
and KOReader sync can return to the same content after a font, orientation, or
indexing-method change instead of relying on a page percentage. Suspended
incremental caches store the same table for their readable prefix; a target
beyond that prefix must continue indexing before it can be resolved.

Version 57 is binary-identical to version 56. The version was bumped because
word-gap suppression now applies only to tokens glued together in the source.
Older caches could collapse explicit spaces between Hangul words, so full and
suspended partial section caches rebuild together. Version 58 recalculates
Bionic Reading split-run offsets with the renderer's combined advance and
kerning rounding, so old cached page positions rebuild.

Version 56 changes `<br>` layout: a line break after text no longer reapplies
the containing block's top or bottom spacing, while an empty `<br>` block keeps
the existing scene-break gap. Full and suspended partial section caches rebuild
together. Version 55 assigns compact IDs to internal EPUB links. The ID is
stored in the existing per-word flags byte and in each page's footnote entry so
touch devices can map tapped text to the existing fragment-navigation path
without retaining another per-word data structure. Version 54 adds compact
ruby-text annotations to serialized text blocks. Only words that begin a ruby
group store annotation text; continuation words use a dedicated style bit. This
keeps books without ruby markup unchanged apart from the cache version while
avoiding an empty string allocation for every word.
Version 53 stores each image's EPUB-internal source path so section indexing can
read only its header and defer full extraction until the page is shown. Version
52 keeps Guide Dots centered when extra word spacing is enabled. Version 51
preserves continuation state for oversized CJK word fragments. Version 50
paginates chapter-heading image runs within the reader viewport so they do not
overflow into the reserved status-bar area. Version 49 stores Bionic Reading
split-run offsets in visual order so RTL word prefixes render on the right.
Version 48 changed Arabic contextual shaping and text measurement, so cached
word positions from version 47 no longer match what `drawText` renders.

Version 48 makes the EPUB word-spacing level widen the natural inter-word gap
(each level adds 10 pixels), which changes laid-out word positions, so
older sections must rebuild. Version 46 added the EPUB word-spacing level to the
cache-busting header. It retains the flat `TextBlock` arena and chapter-opener
anchor behavior introduced in version 45. It includes:

- cache-busting fields for font, line compression, extra paragraph spacing,
  forced paragraph indents, paragraph alignment, viewport size, hyphenation,
  embedded CSS, image rendering mode, Bionic Reading, Guide Dots, word spacing,
  and EPUB render mode
- page offset LUT
- anchor-to-page map for fragment and footnote navigation
- paragraph and list-item LUTs used by KOReader sync page refinement
- visible-text-offset LUT used to resolve page positions across reflow and sync
- optional per-word Bionic Reading split metadata
- optional per-word Guide Dot x-offset metadata
- optional per-word text flags for CSS backgrounds, layout-inserted hyphens,
  and internal-link IDs
- reading-aid layout that stores Bionic Reading and Guide Dots as per-word metadata instead of temporary layout words
- publisher CSS page-break handling and adjusted justification spacing baked into page layout
- table fragments
- per-page footnote entries
- per-page publisher page markers
- serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and
  subscript
- flat TextBlock word storage: per-word arrays plus one shared NUL-terminated
  text blob, replacing length-prefixed word strings and parallel vectors. The
  on-disk order mirrors the in-RAM arena so the firmware reads a whole block
  payload with a single allocation and a single SD read
