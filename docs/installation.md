# Installation

## Supported device

Xteink X3 only. Do not install this build on an X4, X4 Pro, Sticky, or another device.

Download the current package from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/thebitsworld/xteink-pokemon-game/releases).

## Full installation

1. Download `xteink-pokemon-x3-full-v<version>.zip` to a computer.
2. Extract the ZIP. Do not copy the ZIP file itself to the SD card.
3. Power off the X3 and put its SD card in the computer.
4. Back up any `/.crosspoint/pokemon*.bin` files if present. Earlier `pokemon-v2-a.bin` and `pokemon-v2-b.bin` saves migrate automatically.
5. Copy `update.bin` to the SD-card root and merge the extracted `pokemon` folder into the root.
6. **Do not format the SD card. Do not delete any existing folder. Do not replace any existing folder.** Keep your books, sleep covers, settings, reading progress, and Pokémon saves in place.
7. Confirm `update.bin` and the visible `pokemon` folder are directly at the SD-card root.
8. If updating from a build that stored artwork under `/.crosspoint/pokemon`, use this full installation once. Do not move or delete the Pokémon save files in `/.crosspoint`.
9. Safely eject the card and return it to the X3.
10. Open **Settings → System → SD Card Firmware Update**, select `update.bin`, and confirm.

The full ZIP contains the firmware and required artwork. It contains no Pokémon saves, books, reader configuration, or reading data.

## Firmware-only Wi-Fi update

Use this only when `/pokemon/` is already installed at the SD-card root. If the artwork is still under `/.crosspoint/pokemon/`, install the full ZIP once instead.

1. Download `xteink-pokemon-x3-firmware-v<version>.bin`.
2. Leave the SD card inside the X3 and open **File Transfer**.
3. Open the address displayed by the X3 in a browser.
4. Upload the `.bin` to the SD-card root.
5. Exit File Transfer.
6. Open **Settings → System → SD Card Firmware Update**, select the file, and confirm.

File Transfer only copies the firmware to the card. The firmware update always runs from the X3's settings.
