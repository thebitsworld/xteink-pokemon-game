# Pokémon game

## Included

## Reading progression

The Pokémon at the top of the Party receives experience from active reading. CrossInk credits time as pages are turned, not while a book is left open or automatic page turning is running.

Wild encounters and item finds can occur every 15–60 minutes. Book progress influences the level and rarity of wild Pokémon. Pending events appear as a `!` on supported dashboards and wait in the Pokémon menu.

Books, reading statistics, and Pokémon saves remain separate.

## Install and saves

Use the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/thebitsworld/xteink-pokemon-game/releases). The full install contains the firmware, Pokémon artwork, Pokédex cards, checksums, and rights notice. It contains no Pokémon saves, books, or reading data.

Pokémon saves are `/.crosspoint/pokemon-a.bin` and `/.crosspoint/pokemon-b.bin`. Back up both files to preserve a collection. Earlier `pokemon-v2-a.bin` and `pokemon-v2-b.bin` saves migrate automatically.

See [Rights and attribution](../RIGHTS_AND_ATTRIBUTION.md) and [Third-party assets](third-party-assets.md) for artwork provenance and the correction or removal process.

## X3 release checks

Before a stable release, verify on a physical X3 that onboarding, Party and PC actions, Pokédex cards, reading experience, saves, both orientations, supported dashboards, and pending events work without a crash report. The simulator cannot validate physical button mapping, e-ink appearance, SD-card behavior, or the X3's constrained heap.
